## Shiny Application Assignment

Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
1. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server  
2. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box  
3. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github  
4. The application must include the following:

- Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)  
- Some operation on the ui input in sever.R  
- Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations  
- You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.  
- The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.  

### My Shiny Application  

My Shiny application is examining the number of deaths in Virginia in 1940. When the population group of either Rural Male, Rural Female, Urban Male, or Urban Female is entered, a bar graph is plotted by age group and the total number of deaths in that population group is given.
When a different population group is entered, a new bar graph will be plotted and the new total number of deaths will be shown.

My application is available on shinyapps.io at the following link: https://rmhatsh.shinyapps.io/Developing_Data_Products_Assignment/ 

## Reproducible Pitch Presentation

You get 5 slides (inclusive of the title slide) to pitch a your app. You're going to create a web page using Slidify or Rstudio Presenter with an html 5 slide deck.

Here's what you need:

1. 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter  
2. Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs  
3. A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box  
4. Your presentation must satisfy the following:

- It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter  
- It must be 5 pages  
- It must be hosted on github or Rpubs  
- It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document
